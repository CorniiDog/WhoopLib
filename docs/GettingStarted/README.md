# Getting Started

## If you do not know C++
I would suggest learning it first. Fortunately, Connor White has a C++ tutorial at [WhoopLib Zero](https://connoratmos.github.io/WhoopLibZero/#/)


## Installation and Download

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **For WhoopLib VEXCode**


1. Install VSCode if not already installed: **[Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)**

2. Open up command prompt/terminal on your computer and download the WhoopLib VEXCode template via:

    ```bash
    cd Desktop

    git clone --branch v1.0.0-alpha https://github.com/ConnorAtmos/WhoopLibVEXCode

    ```


3. Open the project in VSCode

#### If you don't have VEXCode installed

1. Install "VEX Robotics" Extension in VSCode

2. You should be prompted to install the C++ extension by Microsoft. This would be using Intellisense (clangd may not work with the VEXCode extension)


#### **For WhoopLib PROS**

1. Install VSCode if not already installed: **[Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)**

2. Open up command prompt/terminal on your computer and download the WhoopLib PROS template via:

    ```bash
    cd Desktop

    git clone --branch v1.0.0-alpha https://github.com/ConnorAtmos/WhoopLibPROS

    ```

3. Open the project in VSCode

#### If you don't have PROS installed

1. Install the "PROS" Extension in VSCode and accept the prompts to install the toolchain

1. You should be prompted to install the C++ extension by Microsoft. This would be using Intellisense, however I would suggest installing the "clangd" extension and disabling Intellisense from the C/C++ extension.
