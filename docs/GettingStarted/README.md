First of all, if you do not know C++, I would suggest learning it first. Fortunately, we have a modified C++ tutorial at WhoopLib Zero:

#### **For WhoopLib VEXCode**


1. Install VSCode

2. Open up command prompt/terminal on your computer and download the VEXCode template via:

    ```bash
    cd Desktop

    git clone https://github.com/ConnorAtmos/WhoopLibVEXCode

    ```

3. Open the project in VSCode

4. Install "VEX Robotics" Extension in VSCode

5. You should be prompted to install the C++ extension by Microsoft. This would be using Intellisense (clangd may not work with the VEXCode extension)


#### **For WhoopLib PROS**

Coming soon
