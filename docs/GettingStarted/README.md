# Getting Started

## If you do not know C++
I would suggest learning it first. Fortunately, Connor White has a C++ tutorial at [WhoopLib Zero](https://connoratmos.github.io/WhoopLibZero/#/)


## Installation and Download

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **For WhoopLib VEXCode**


1. Install VSCode

2. Open up command prompt/terminal on your computer and download the WhoopLib VEXCode template via:

    ```bash
    cd Desktop

    git clone https://github.com/ConnorAtmos/WhoopLibVEXCode

    ```

3. Open the project in VSCode

4. Install "VEX Robotics" Extension in VSCode

5. You should be prompted to install the C++ extension by Microsoft. This would be using Intellisense (clangd may not work with the VEXCode extension)


#### **For WhoopLib PROS**

1. Install VSCode

2. Open up command prompt/terminal on your computer and download the WhoopLib PROS template via:

    ```bash
    cd Desktop

    git clone https://github.com/ConnorAtmos/WhoopLibPROS

    ```

3. Open the project in VSCode

4. Install the "PROS" Extension in VSCode

5. You should be prompted to install the C++ extension by Microsoft. This would be using Intellisense, however I would suggest installing the "clangd" extension and disabling Intellisense from the C/C++ extension.
