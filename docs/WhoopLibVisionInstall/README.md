# Installation & Setup

The installation process for the vision system is likely the most complicated part. So, in an attempt to streamline the process
we have provided enough documentation to either install from a backup file or build from source.

## Installing WiFi Module

Refer to [This Link](https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/360048489132-Installing-the-Intel-Dual-Band-Wi-Fi-and-Antennas-for-VEX-AI) that
properly explains how to install the WiFi module onto the Jetson Nano
